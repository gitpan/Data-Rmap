0.64 -  Pod fixes from RT#51735 (Sergey Romanov)
        Link to github in Build.PL (David Steinbrunner)

Fri Dec 30 10:52:54 EST 2011
0.63 -  Added CODE as another :type, rmap_code to only replace CODE refs
        (in :all export too) and also recurse into the CODE slot of a glob.
        Note that CODE is not part of ALL, you need rmap_to with (ALL | CODE).
        Recursing the CODE slot of GLOB *IS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE*
        (but rare enough and hard to wrok-around).

        steven haryanto requested this in RT#73550, thanks
